            		<Run Text="Nakshi Kantha or embroidered quilt is made and used almost everywhere in Bangladesh. However, the nakshi kanthas of Rajshahi, Jessore, and Faridpur are most famous for stitch craft and picturesque designs. Several layers of old cloth are put together to make these quilts. Apart from being used to make pillow cases and covers, prayer mats, seats for puja, small  bags for keeping mirrors and combs, filaf (covers) for books, covers for foods, and dastarkhan or dining mats. The designs were traditionally drawn free hand by women who worked leisurely in their spare time. At present much nakshi kantha work is done by NGOS and handicraft organizations for commercial purposes. Common motifs are the lotus, the sun, the moon, stars, leaves, trees, flowering creepers, human figures, deities, horses, elephants, fish, birds, TAZIAS and rath. Elaborately embroidered quilts depict scenes from mythology or contemporary life. Traditionally, threads drawn from sari borders were used. At present embroidery thread is used or skeins of yarn."/>
